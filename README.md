# Radiogenomics: Integrative Analysis Pipeline

## Overview

This project looks focuses on identifying predictors of treatment response by leveraging and integrating various patient data modalities. Specifically, this project focuses on discovering associations between radiomic and genomic features predictive of patient outcomes.

We integrate two parallel initiatives: **radiomics**, which investigates radiological medical images to identify features that inform patient phenotypic attributes, and **genomics**, where we leverage patient molecular profiles to identify patterns (or "signatures") of gene expression associated with patient outcomes. At its core, this project investigates the association between radiomic features, genomic signatures, and patient outcomes.

## Research Hypothesis

**Quantitative imaging features (radiomics) correlate with underlying genomic signatures, and these correlations can predict patient treatment response and survival outcomes.**

This hypothesis is based on the understanding that:
1. Radiomic features capture tumor phenotypes resulting from underlying molecular processes
2. Gene expression patterns influence cellular behavior visible in imaging
3. Combined radiomic and genomic information provides more robust predictive models

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives
- **Discover Radiogenomic Associations**: Identify significant correlations between quantitative imaging features and genomic pathway signatures across cancer types
- **Clinical Outcome Prediction**: Develop integrated models predicting treatment response and survival outcomes
- **Biomarker Identification**: Identify radiomic-genomic feature pairs serving as predictive biomarkers

### Secondary Objectives
- **Cross-Cancer Validation**: Assess generalizability across cancer types and imaging modalities
- **Mechanistic Understanding**: Investigate biological pathways underlying radiogenomic correlations
- **Clinical Translation**: Develop clinically applicable models for routine oncological practice
